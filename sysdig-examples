This is an ever growing list of cool things you can do with sysdig commands.

Note: the command lines on this page return live data. However, you can use them with trace files too by just adding the -r switch.

#Networking
============

See the top processes in terms of network bandwidth usage
sysdig -c topprocs_net

Show the network data exchanged with the host 192.168.0.1
as binary:
sysdig -s2000 -X -c echo_fds fd.cip=192.168.0.1
as ASCII:
sysdig -s2000 -A -c echo_fds fd.cip=192.168.0.1

See the top local server ports
in terms of established connections:
sysdig -c fdcount_by fd.sport "evt.type=accept"
in terms of total bytes:
sysdig -c fdbytes_by fd.sport

See the top client IPs
in terms of established connections
sysdig -c fdcount_by fd.cip "evt.type=accept"
in terms of total bytes
sysdig -c fdbytes_by fd.cip

List all the incoming connections that are not served by apache.
sysdig -p"%proc.name %fd.name" "evt.type=accept and proc.name!=httpd"

See queries made via apache to an external MySQL server happening in real time
sysdig -A -c echo_fds fd.sip=192.168.30.5 and proc.name=apache2 and evt.buffer contains SELECT


Disk I/O
=========

See the top processes in terms of disk bandwidth usage
sysdig -c topprocs_file

List the processes that are using a high number of files
sysdig -c fdcount_by proc.name "fd.type=file"

See the top files in terms of read+write bytes
sysdig -c topfiles_bytes

Print the top files that apache has been reading from or writing to
sysdig -c topfiles_bytes proc.name=httpd

Basic opensnoop: snoop file opens as they occur
sysdig -p "%12user.name %6proc.pid %12proc.name %3fd.num %fd.typechar %fd.name" evt.type=open


Processes and CPU usage
========================

See the top processes in terms of CPU usage
sysdig -c topprocs_cpu

See the top processes for CPU 0
sysdig -c topprocs_cpu evt.cpu=0

Observe the standard output of a process
sysdig -s4096 -A -c stdout proc.name=cat


Performance and Errors
=======================

See all the failed file opens by httpd
sysdig "proc.name=httpd and evt.type=open and evt.failed=true"

See the files where most time has been spent
sysdig -c topfiles_time

See the files where apache spent most time
sysdig -c topfiles_time proc.name=httpd

See the top processes in terms of I/O errors
sysdig -c topprocs_errors

See the top files in terms of I/O errors
sysdig -c topfiles_errors

See the system calls where most time has been spent
sysdig -c topscalls_time

See the top system calls returning errors
sysdig -c topscalls "evt.failed=true"

snoop failed file opens as they occur
sysdig -p "%12user.name %6proc.pid %12proc.name %3fd.num %fd.typechar %fd.name" evt.type=open and evt.failed=true

Print the file I/O calls that have a latency greater than 1ms:
sysdig -c fileslower 1


Security
=========

Show the directories that the user "root" visits
sysdig -p"%evt.arg.path" "evt.type=chdir and user.name=root"

Observe ssh activity
sysdig -A -c echo_fds fd.name=/dev/ptmx and proc.name=sshd

Show every file open that happens in /etc
sysdig evt.type=open and fd.name contains /etc
